# ROB498: Robotics Capstone Design

This repository showcases my work for ROB498, the Robotics Capstone Design course. My team and I are building a fully functional robot drone - a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) in fact! - tackling all parts of the "sense-plan-act" cycle as well as assembling the hardware. From brainstorming designs to prototyping and testing, we’re this project holistically combines all of our engineering skills into creating hardware and software that work together to solve a real-world robotics challenge. In this repository, you'll find everything from design ideas and code to performance evaluations and final reports. It’s been a hands-on, technical adventure, pulling together everything we’ve learned and pushing the limits of what we can create as a team.
